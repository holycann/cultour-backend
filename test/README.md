# Cultour Backend Test Suite

## Overview
This test suite provides comprehensive testing for the Cultour backend services, repositories, and handlers.

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- `go test` command
- `testify` library for assertions and mocking

### Execute Tests
To run all tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

To run tests for a specific package:
```bash
go test ./test/users/services
go test ./test/users/handlers
```

## Test Coverage
- Services: Unit tests for core business logic
- Repositories: Mocked database interactions
- Handlers: Request/response validation and routing tests

## Mocking Strategy
We use `testify/mock` for creating mock implementations of repositories and external dependencies.

## Best Practices
- Each test focuses on a single scenario
- Use meaningful test names
- Cover both successful and error cases
- Validate input validation, business logic, and error handling

## Continuous Integration
These tests are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
