Comprehensive Backend Audit & Refactoring Plan – Cultour Project

Perform an in-depth backend analysis and propose actionable improvements based on the following focus areas. The goal is to improve maintainability, enforce SOLID and DRY principles, enhance security, and streamline backend flow without introducing new features—unless strictly needed for refactoring and structural integrity.

1. Project Structure & Architecture
   Unify and normalize internal structures across domain packages.

Centralize and reuse common validation logic to reduce redundancy.

2. SOLID Principles Review
   Single Responsibility Principle: Refactor handlers that combine request validation and response formatting.

Open/Closed Principle: Abstract and generalize implementations to allow easy extension without modifying core logic.

Interface Segregation Principle: Split large interfaces (e.g., repositories) into smaller, focused contracts.

Dependency Inversion Principle: Decouple service logic from Supabase-specific implementations via proper abstractions.

3. DRY Principle Review
   Eliminate duplicated logic in handlers such as:

Repeated validation in event_handler.go, thread_handler.go

Similar pagination code in ListEvent, SearchEvents, ListThreads, etc.

Redundant image upload logic across multiple services

4. Error Handling
   Define and use domain-specific custom error types.

Standardize error messages for consistency and user clarity.

Implement granular error handling for more informative client responses.

5. Code Quality & Best Practices
   Refactor long methods (e.g., CreateEvent, UpdateEvent) into smaller, manageable units.

Replace hardcoded values with constants or config variables.

Enforce comprehensive input validation across endpoints.

Address inconsistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.

6. Security Improvements
   Strengthen file upload handling (e.g., validation, MIME type checks).

Introduce API rate limiting for high-traffic endpoints.

Implement robust input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

7. Database Design
   Add missing indexes, especially for foreign key relationships.

Define additional constraints to enforce data integrity at the database level.

8. Backend Flow Enhancements
   a) Request-Response Flow
   Enrich request context for better observability and tracing.

Implement API throttling/rate-limiting middleware.

b) Data Flow Between Layers
Remove direct repository access from handlers—enforce service-layer boundaries.

Introduce DTOs to manage and restrict data exposure between layers.

c) Business Process Flow
Refactor monolithic flows like event creation into modular steps:

Authentication → Validation → Image Upload → DB Record Creation → Linked Records

Add domain events for decoupling and improved observability.

9. API Design & Organization
   Keep API paths organized by domain, but improve granularity (e.g., /events/{id}/views).

Add HATEOAS-style hypermedia links for better API discoverability.

Standardize pagination formats and patterns across all list endpoints.

10. Middleware Architecture
    Introduce request validation middleware.

Apply granular rate limiting per route or domain.

Enable compression for large request/response payloads to optimize bandwidth.

Objective:
Guide the refactoring and optimization process using this analysis. Focus on internal consistency, structural improvements, and adherence to software architecture principles, without introducing new user-facing features.
