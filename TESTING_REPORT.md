# Cultour Backend Testing Strategy and Report

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Cultour backend, detailing the approach, coverage, and insights gained from our test suite.

## Test Suite Architecture
The test suite is designed with the following key principles:
- Modular and domain-specific test files
- Comprehensive endpoint coverage
- Simulated authentication scenarios
- Detailed error reporting

### Test Files
1. `user_test.go`: User management endpoint tests
2. `place_test.go`: City and Province endpoint tests
3. `discussion_test.go`: Thread and message endpoint tests
4. `cultural_test.go`: Event and local story endpoint tests
5. `gemini_test.go`: AI interaction endpoint tests

## Test Scenarios Covered

### Authentication and Authorization
- Unauthorized access tests for protected routes
- Simulated JWT verification checks
- Role-based access control validation

### Endpoint Validation
For each domain, we test the following scenarios:
- Listing resources
- Searching resources
- Creating resources (unauthorized attempts)
- Retrieving specific resources
- Error handling for invalid inputs

### Specific Test Cases

#### User Endpoints
- List users (unauthorized)
- Search users (unauthorized)
- Create user (unauthorized)

#### Place Endpoints
- List cities and provinces
- Search cities and provinces
- Create city/province (unauthorized)

#### Discussion Endpoints
- List threads
- Search threads (unauthorized)
- Create thread (unauthorized)

#### Cultural Endpoints
- List events and local stories
- Search events and local stories
- Create event/local story (unauthorized)

#### Gemini AI Endpoints
- General AI query
- Event-specific AI query
- Empty query handling

## Testing Methodology
- Uses Go's built-in testing framework
- Utilizes `testify` for assertions
- Dependency injection for flexible testing
- Simulated HTTP request/response cycles

## Reporting and Logging
- Generates timestamped test reports
- Captures stdout and stderr
- Provides summary of total, passed, and failed tests
- Stores detailed logs for further investigation

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- Current tests focus on status code and basic response validation
- Future enhancements:
  1. Add more detailed response body validation
  2. Implement mock database for more comprehensive testing
  3. Add performance and load testing
  4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

## Running Tests
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run all tests
go test ./tests/...

# Run specific test file
go test ./tests/user_test.go
```

## Conclusion
The test suite provides a robust initial validation of the Cultour backend's endpoint functionality, ensuring basic reliability and catching potential integration issues early in the development process.

### Test Coverage Metrics
- Total Domains Tested: 5
- Total Test Cases: ~20
- Focus: Endpoint Accessibility and Basic Functionality

**Note:** This test suite is a starting point and should be continuously expanded as the application grows and more complex scenarios are introduced.
